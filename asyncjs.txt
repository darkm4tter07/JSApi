#Async Javascript(Start something now and finish it later)

-Governs how we perform tasks which take some time to complete(e.g. getting data from database)

JS can run ONE statement at a time

This is example of synchronous code:
Stmt 1 -> 
stmt 2 -> 
stmt 3(takes time and it blocks stmt 4 from running until it completes) -> 
stmt 4

Asynchronous Code
stmt 1 -> 
stmt 2 -> 
stmt 3(takes time, it is taken by callback function which takes it outside of scope from thread) -> 
stmt 4 ->
[Callback function where, stmt 3 is passed as parameter] This will call again stmt 3 after when it gets executed(eg. getting data from database)


#HTTP Requests

-Make HTTP requests to get data from another server
-We make these requests to API endpoints

We'll play here with JSON format API, where JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

eg.This is a JSON response data from request URL:
'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
This data is got by a request URL with certain request method(eg. GET,POST,PUT, PATCH, DELETE);
GET vs POST
-GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
-POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
